Steps for generating a profile-guided optimization (PGO) build:

    1. Select PGInstrument build config and rebuild solution.
    2. Run the training program (e.g. x64\PGInstrument\StringTable2BenchmarkExe.exe)
    3. Run update-pgd.bat.
    4. Select PGOptimize build config and *build* solution.  Don't select
       rebuild, as it deletes all the .pgd files generated by the PGInstrument
       phase and generally breaks everything.
