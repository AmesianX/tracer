Routine Description:

    Searches a string table to see if any strings "prefix match" the given
    search string.  That is, whether any string in the table "starts with
    or is equal to" the search string.

Arguments:

    StringTable - Supplies a pointer to a STRING_TABLE struct.

    String - Supplies a pointer to a STRING struct that contains the string to
        search for.

    Match - Optionally supplies a pointer to a variable that contains the
        address of a STRING_MATCH structure.  This will be populated with
        additional details about the match if a non-NULL pointer is supplied.

Return Value:

    Index of the prefix match if one was found, NO_MATCH_FOUND if not.

    //     other strings in the table) across a second Xmm register.
    //
    //  2. Load the string table's unique character array into an Xmm register.
    //
    //  3. Broadcast the search string's length into a Xmm register.
    //
    //  3. Load the string table's slot lengths array into a Xmm register.
    //
    //  4. Compare the unique character from step 1 to the string table's unique
    //     character array set up in step 2.  The result of this comparison
    //     will produce an XMM register with each byte set to either 0xff if
    //     the unique character was found, or 0x0 if it wasn't.
    //
    //  5. Compare the search string's length from step 3 to the string table's

Routine Description:

    Searches a string table to see if any strings "prefix match" the given
    search string.  That is, whether any string in the table "starts with
    or is equal to" the search string.

Arguments:

    StringTable - Supplies a pointer to a STRING_TABLE struct.

    String - Supplies a pointer to a STRING struct that contains the string to
        search for.

    Match - Optionally supplies a pointer to a variable that contains the
        address of a STRING_MATCH structure.  This will be populated with
        additional details about the match if a non-NULL pointer is supplied.

Return Value:

    Index of the prefix match if one was found, NO_MATCH_FOUND if not.

Routine Description:

    Searches a string table to see if any strings "prefix match" the given
    search string.  That is, whether any string in the table "starts with
    or is equal to" the search string.

Arguments:

    StringTable - Supplies a pointer to a STRING_TABLE struct.

    String - Supplies a pointer to a STRING struct that contains the string to
        search for.

    Match - Optionally supplies a pointer to a variable that contains the
        address of a STRING_MATCH structure.  This will be populated with
        additional details about the match if a non-NULL pointer is supplied.

Return Value:

    Index of the prefix match if one was found, NO_MATCH_FOUND if not.

    //     other strings in the table) across a second Xmm register.
    //
    //  2. Load the string table's unique character array into an Xmm register.
    //
    //  3. Broadcast the search string's length into a Xmm register.
    //
    //  3. Load the string table's slot lengths array into a Xmm register.
    //
    //  4. Compare the unique character from step 1 to the string table's unique
    //     character array set up in step 2.  The result of this comparison
    //     will produce an XMM register with each byte set to either 0xff if
    //     the unique character was found, or 0x0 if it wasn't.

    //  5. Compare the search string's length from step 3 to the string table's
